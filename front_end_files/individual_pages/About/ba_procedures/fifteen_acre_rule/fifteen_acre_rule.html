<!--Boundary Amendment Procedures - Fifteen Acre Rule -->
<strong><h4>FIFTEEN ACRE RULE</h4></strong>

<p>In an effort to streamline the decision-making process, the law was amended in 1985 to allow applicants for land use changes of 15 acres or less to apply directly to the counties. The Commission, therefore, no longer handles such requests except when the lands are situated within the Conservation District.

All amendments approved by the counties are submitted to the State Land Use Commission Office in Honolulu for revision of the Official State Land Use District Boundaries Maps.</p>
